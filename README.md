# drone-controller
An Arduino drone controller, using the MPU6050 gyroscope and accelerometer, controlled through radio.  
It uses the MPU6050 library from [ElectronicCats](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/mpu6050).  
**Project abandoned. If you want to use it, you'll need to edit the pins in the PinUtils.h header and troubleshoot any issues you'll encounter.**
